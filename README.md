# PyES
</p>

PyES is a sotware created by the chemistry department of the University of Turin in collabration with the University of Messina and the University of Bialystok.

Based on the previous work of Professor Sammartano of the University of Messina, PyES aims to empower researchers with the ability to easily compute species distribution and simulate titration curves even for complex systems containing preciptiable species.
