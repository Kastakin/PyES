# PyES Version 0.2.3

Moved to new software stack:
* [Custom PPG](https://github.com/runesc/PPG) instead of [fbs](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs) to allow the use of newer Python and library versions;
* [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/quickstart.html) over PyQt5;
* Moved the virtualenv handling to [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
