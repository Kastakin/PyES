# PyES4 Version 0.1.0

First release for PyES4. This build isn't a complete product and more functionality refinement will be intoduced via hotfix and/or patches.

As of today the software is able to compute the distribution of species for various systems given the components and their analytical concentrations in addition to the formation constants for the various species.

The output solution can be computed with constant or variable ionic strength. The referenc ionic strength the terms of the Debye–Hückel equation can be defined on a species base or globally.

Some plotting functionality is present with the ability to show the distribution of species plotted against the indipendent component concentration.

The results from the calculation can be exported as .xlsx/.csv files.

For the time being these functions are still disabled but their introduction is planned for future releases:

* Simulation of titration curves.
* Propagation of uncertainty and relative errors.
* Solid phases
